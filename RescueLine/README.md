# Rescue - Line

A project to create a simple, functional, low-cost robot for use in RoboCup Junior Rescue Line competition. [Full competition information and rules can be found here](https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-line/).

The current design (version 7.4) is created to use as many simple parts that may be available in a given technology classroom (TT motors, arduino boards etc.)

The design files include laser cutting files and fusion 360 design files. The design is created to be cut from 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick MDF wood. It can be modified and improved, made out of cardboard or have components hot-glued on. The design is intentionally functional, but not optimal. This is a choice to encourage student design and modification in the spirit of RoboCup.

A video of the working robot showing line following and obstacle avoidance in a student activity is included in this directory.
