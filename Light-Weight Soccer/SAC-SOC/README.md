# SAC-SOC

A minimal robot based on the simple design of the SAC-BOT for soccer robot construction.


## Stage One: Robotic Design Overview

### Plate 1 - Drive System

- **Motors:** Four TT motors positioned at 90Â° from each other
- **Wheels:** Standard plastic wheels (utilizing slipperiness for omni-drive functionality)
- **Assembly:** Motors bolted into place
- **Wiring:** Four wires run upward to Plate 2

### Plate 2 - Control System

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno
- **Motor Control:** Motor controller mounted
- **Servos:** Two servos mounted for Plate 3 positioning

### Plate 3 - Sensor Array

- **Location:** Positioned above the motor driver
- **Sensors:** IR sensors with cicada pattern angle detection
- **Purpose:** Player ball detection
